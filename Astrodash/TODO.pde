// name for leaderboard score
// pause instructions
// create another audio clip of warp with just the end part, so that if the player reaches a checkpoint while still warping, it cuts the warp sound short
// side booster mini flame, and make it a smoother animation when boosting
// meteoroids that collide should be repelled in opposite directions (needs to follow real physics, where depending on speed and mass, the other will be affected accordingly)
// clear leaderboard scores (needs confirmation screen (Y/N key check))
// could randomise the amount of meteors being spawned each time? (would have to be based on a randomised respawn timer for each meteor)
// make explosion of meteor randomised even more
// add exclamation mark in triangle for damaged screen
// when low on health, fade the exclamation mark in and out slowly
// pulse animates from rocket when checkpoint reached? (two transparent white circles, one has thicker stroke to make it look like a glow)
